# MaximumTrainer

An open-source, high-performance indoor cycling training application built with the **Qt framework (C++17)**. MaximumTrainer delivers structured interval workouts with real-time power, cadence, heart rate, and speed feedback, and controls smart trainers automatically via FTMS ERG mode. Browse and sync workouts from [TrainerDay.com](https://www.trainerday.com/), or import your own `.erg` / `.mrc` files.

## Technical Overview

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Language** | C++17 (≈ 95 % C++) |
| **Framework** | Qt 5.15.2 (Windows / Linux) · Qt 6.7.3 (macOS) |
| **Build file** | `PowerVelo.pro` (qmake) |
| **Qt modules** | core · gui · widgets · network · bluetooth · webenginewidgets · printsupport · concurrent |
| **Trainer protocol** | Bluetooth LE Fitness Machine Service (FTMS / 0x1826) for ERG resistance control |
| **Sensor profiles** | Heart Rate (0x180D) · Cycling Speed & Cadence (0x1816) · Cycling Power (0x1818) |
| **Workout formats** | `.erg`, `.mrc` (imported and converted to the native `.workout` XML format) |
| **Workout source** | Integrated TrainerDay.com browser for online workout plans |

## Hardware Setup

### 1 — Wake up your sensors

| Device | How to wake it |
|--------|---------------|
| Smart trainer | Start pedalling for a few seconds |
| Power meter | Start pedalling |
| Heart rate strap | Moisten the electrode contacts and put it on |
| Speed / cadence sensor | Spin the crank or wheel |

### 2 — Connect in the app

1. Launch MaximumTrainer and log in.
2. From the main window open **Preferences → Device Connections** (or press the gear icon).
3. Click **Scan / Add Devices**. The BTLE scanner lists every nearby Bluetooth LE device.
4. Select the correct profile for each sensor:

| Profile | UUID | Data provided | Smart-trainer ERG control |
|---------|------|--------------|--------------------------|
| Heart Rate Monitor | 0x180D | Heart rate (bpm) | No |
| Cycling Speed & Cadence | 0x1816 | Speed (km/h) · Cadence (RPM) | No |
| Cycling Power | 0x1818 | Power (W) | No |
| **Fitness Machine (FTMS)** | **0x1826** | Speed · Cadence · Power | **Yes — enables ERG mode** |

> **Important:** Select the **Fitness Machine (FTMS / 0x1826)** profile for your smart trainer if you want the app to set resistance automatically. Choosing a plain Power or Speed profile disables ERG control.

5. Paired sensors appear with a green indicator. You can pair multiple sensors simultaneously (e.g. FTMS trainer + HR strap).

### Simulation mode

If you have no hardware — or want to test a new workout — choose **Simulation** in the connection dialog. The software hub emits realistic drifting values:

| Channel | Base value | Range |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Heart rate | 140 bpm | 125–165 bpm |
| Cadence | 90 rpm | 80–100 rpm |
| Speed | 28 km/h | 23–33 km/h |
| Power | 200 W | 170–260 W |

The simulator responds to ERG load commands from the workout player, making it a full end-to-end test of the training logic without any Bluetooth hardware.

## User Guide

### Selecting a workout

**Option A — TrainerDay.com library (integrated)**

1. Click the **Find Workouts** tab in the left sidebar.
2. Browse or search the TrainerDay.com catalogue directly inside the app.
3. Double-click a workout to download it to your local library.

**Option B — Import a custom file**

1. Go to **File → Import Workout** (or **File → Import Course Folder** for batch import).
2. Select one or more `.erg` or `.mrc` files.
3. MaximumTrainer converts them to its native format and adds them to your library.

**Option C — Create your own**

Use the built-in **Workout Creator** (toolbar → pencil icon) to build structured intervals with configurable power, cadence, or HR targets.

### Workout modes

| Mode | How it works | Best for |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **ERG** | App automatically adjusts trainer resistance so your actual power matches the target wattage. You control only cadence. | Structured interval workouts |
| **Slope / Manual** | App sends a constant incline grade to the trainer. Resistance changes naturally with speed, just like riding outdoors. | Free-riding, ramp tests, courses |

The workout dialog switches to Slope mode automatically when the current interval has no power target, or when you press **Increase / Decrease Difficulty** to override ERG.

### The Workout Player

Once a workout starts you will see:

- **Interval countdown** — time remaining in the current interval, and total workout time elapsed / remaining.
- **Target vs. Actual Power graph** — a QWT-based real-time plot showing the structured intervals as coloured zones and your live power overlaid on top.
- **Metrics widgets** — live Heart Rate · Cadence · Speed · Power · Left/Right Power Balance (if a dual-sided power meter is connected) · SpO₂ (if an oxygen sensor is connected).
- **Controls** — Start/Pause, Skip Interval, Adjust Difficulty (±5 % FTP increments), and Lap.

Completed workout data is saved as a FIT activity file and can be uploaded to **Strava**, **TrainingPeaks**, or **SelfLoops** from the post-workout screen.

## Screenshots

> **Note:** Screenshots showing the cross-platform UI will be added here. Contributions of high-quality screenshots on each platform are welcome — please open a pull request.

| Platform | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Windows | Main workout player with power graph and metrics |
| macOS | Dashboard showing the TrainerDay.com workout browser |
| Linux | App running on Ubuntu — proof of cross-platform build |
| Device Manager | BTLE scanner with multiple sensors connected |

## Linux — Bluetooth Setup

Before running MaximumTrainer on Linux, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

### 1 — BlueZ daemon

BlueZ is the Linux Bluetooth stack. Install it and make sure the daemon starts automatically:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y bluez
sudo systemctl enable --now bluetooth
```

Verify the daemon is active:

```bash
sudo systemctl status bluetooth
```

### 2 — Add your user to the `bluetooth` group

If the BLE device scanner shows an empty list and no error, the most common cause is that your account is not in the `bluetooth` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG bluetooth $USER
```

> **Important:** Group changes take effect only after you **log out and back in** (or reboot). You can apply the change to the current shell session immediately — without logging out — by running:
> ```bash
> newgrp bluetooth
> ```

### 3 — Confirm your adapter supports Bluetooth LE (4.0+)

MaximumTrainer requires a Bluetooth 4.0 or newer adapter to communicate with BLE sensors and trainers. Check your adapter:

```bash
hciconfig -a
```

Look for `LMP Version: 6` (BT 4.0) or higher in the output. If `hciconfig` is not available, use:

```bash
bluetoothctl show
```

### 4 — Verify required kernel modules are loaded

The following kernel modules must be loaded:

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `bluetooth` | Core BLE/Bluetooth stack |
| `hci_uart` | UART-attached adapters (most USB dongles) |
| `btusb` | USB Bluetooth adapters |

Check and load if needed:

```bash
lsmod | grep -E "bluetooth|hci_uart|btusb"
# If missing, load manually:
sudo modprobe bluetooth
sudo modprobe btusb
```

On most modern distributions (Ubuntu 20.04+, Fedora 36+) these modules load automatically when a Bluetooth adapter is detected.

## Building

All three platforms are built and tested automatically via GitHub Actions CI (see `.github/workflows/build.yml`). Use `PowerVelo.pro` with `qmake` and a standard C++ compiler.

### Dependencies

| Dependency | Version | Platform | Notes |
|------------|---------|----------|-------|
| Qt | 5.15.2 | Windows · Linux | Core framework |
| Qt | 6.7.3 | macOS | Core framework |
| QWT | 6.2.0 | all | Plotting widgets (built from source) |
| VLC-Qt | 1.1.0 (Win) · 1.1.1 from source (Linux) | Windows · Linux | Internet radio / video player |
| SFML | 2.6.1 (Win) · system package (Linux/macOS) | all | Audio feedback |

## Windows — Requirements

- **Windows 10 version 1703 (Creators Update) or later is required.**
  Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 are not supported (missing WinRT BLE APIs).
- A Bluetooth 4.0+ adapter with a WDM-compatible driver.
- No special permissions or manifest entries are needed.

### Windows

**Required tools:** Qt 5.15.2 (msvc2019_64), Visual Studio 2019+ (MSVC), 7-Zip

**Environment variables** — set before running `qmake`:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `QTDIR` | Qt installation root for the target arch | `C:\Qt\5.15.2\msvc2019_64` |
| `VLCQT_DIR` | VLC-Qt installation root (forward slashes) | `C:/vlcqt` |
| `QMAKEFEATURES` | Path to QWT features directory | `C:\qwt\features` |

**qmake invocation:**
```powershell
$env:QMAKEFEATURES = "C:\qwt\features"
qmake PowerVelo.pro `
  "VLCQT_INSTALL=C:/vlcqt" `
  "SFML_INSTALL=C:/sfml/SFML-2.6.1"
```

> `VLCQT_INSTALL` must point to the VLC-Qt package root (containing `bin/`, `include/`, `lib/`). The pre-built 1.1.0 win64 MSVC package places import `.lib` files directly in `lib/`.  
> `SFML_INSTALL` must point to the SFML root (the directory containing `include/` and `lib/`).  
> The Windows Kit libraries (`Gdi32`, `User32`) are resolved automatically by the MSVC linker — no `WINKIT_INSTALL` is needed when building inside an MSVC developer command prompt.

### Linux (Ubuntu 22.04)

Install system packages and build VLC-Qt from source, then build the app:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y \
  qtbase5-dev qtwebengine5-dev qtconnectivity5-dev \
  libqwt-qt5-dev libsfml-dev libvlc-dev libvlccore-dev \
  cmake build-essential

# Build VLC-Qt 1.1.1 from source
cd /tmp && git clone --branch 1.1.1 --depth 1 https://github.com/vlc-qt/vlc-qt
cd vlc-qt && mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DQT_VERSION=5 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
make -j$(nproc) && sudo make install && sudo ldconfig

# Build MaximumTrainer
cd /path/to/MaximumTrainer_Redux
export PATH=/usr/lib/qt5/bin:$PATH
qmake PowerVelo.pro "INCLUDEPATH+=/usr/local/include" "LIBS+=-L/usr/local/lib"
make -j$(nproc)
```

### macOS

Uses Qt 6.7.3 with Clang. QWT is built from source (non-framework) against Qt 6. VLC-Qt is optional on macOS.

```bash
# Install Qt 6.7.3 via install-qt-action or the Qt Installer, then:
brew install sfml

# Build QWT 6.2.0 from source (non-framework, required for Qt 6)
curl -L -o /tmp/qwt.tar.bz2 "https://sourceforge.net/projects/qwt/files/qwt/6.2.0/qwt-6.2.0.tar.bz2/download"
tar -xjf /tmp/qwt.tar.bz2 -C /tmp && cd /tmp/qwt-6.2.0
sed -i.bak 's/QwtFramework//' qwtconfig.pri
qmake qwt.pro && make -j$(sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu) && sudo make install

# Build MaximumTrainer
cd /path/to/MaximumTrainer_Redux
qmake PowerVelo.pro \
  "SFML_INSTALL=$(brew --prefix sfml)" \
  "QWT_INSTALL=/usr/local/qwt-6.2.0"
make
```

## Testing

BTLE sensor-data parsing is validated by a headless Qt Test suite in `tests/btle/` — no real hardware required. Tests run on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS in CI.

### Running the tests

```bash
cd tests/btle
qmake btle_tests.pro
make -j$(nproc)
../../build/tests/btle_tests -v2
```

### Test output (Ubuntu 22.04, Qt 5.15.2)

![BTLE tests — 28 passed, 0 failed](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62d82bce-1dd0-40c4-91fe-159ee6aeb8b9)

## Language

Language files are used at runtime from the `/language` folder.
You need Qt Linguist to open and generate a new language file (`.qm` file).

## TODO

Project now going through new revisions, with plans to enhance as an open-source interval trainer for indoor cycling & indoor rowing.
